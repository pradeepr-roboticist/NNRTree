# NNRTree

This is a C++ class wrapper around the Boost RTree library.

## Limitations
1. Since, the dimension (DIM) of the RTree is a compile-time constant. Users have to manually define the dimension and appropriately modify the member functions in NNRTree.cpp for arbitrary dimensions. A good workaround is setting an upperbound dimension (say 10) and whenever you are working with k < DIM, you can set the rest of the (DIM-k) dimensions to be zero.
